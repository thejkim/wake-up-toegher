# Wake Up Together
A Node.js server and Android alarm application that people can manage and share their alarm patterns. They can share their own alarms as well as use a set of alarms shared by others. They would wake up, work out, study, whatever one does regularly, all together. Hope it would help them to be encouraged in their lifestyle.
